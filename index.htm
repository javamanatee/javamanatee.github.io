<p>This is a launch page for some projects on Github, which provides a pretty easy (and free) way to host Javascript content.</p>

<p class="pad"><a href="fed_reserve.htm">Federal Reserve Mechanics</a></p>
<p>Showing how the Federal Reserve buys assets, and how that translates into monetary base, currency, and bank deposits.  The Quantitative Easing (QE) that began in 2008 in response to that financial crisis marks a notable departure from previous monetary policy.  Use the slider to move back and forth over time to see how this played out.</p>
<p class="pad"><a href="essex_overlay.htm">Overlay Map of Essex</a></p>
<p>This is an overlay of one page of the Chapman and Andre map of Essex, England, from 1777.  It has been closely matched up to the location on Google Maps.  Use the slider to change transparency.  There is a close match in location of roads, buildings, and estates.  Many place names are preserved.  Some of my ancestors came from Wethersfield, in the upper left corner of the map.</p>
